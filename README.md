# InstaBot

Hello everyone,
This script will give you the option to create an Instagram bot that can send a message to a user or several users at the same time.
Also most of the options you will find online use Selenium library so it occasionally parallels the bot to work properly.
Here I created browser automation without using selenium but only by mouse and keyboard commands using pyautogui.
But before you use the script you need to do a few simple steps:
1. Go to your browser and open instagram.com website
2. Go to the browser settings
3. Access cookies and site permissions.
4. Go to 'Clear at exit' and add instagram.com

now you can use in this bot... goodluck!
